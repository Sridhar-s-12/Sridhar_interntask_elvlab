Even popular browser extensions can be unsafe due to privacy violations, malware, or malicious updates. Here are some widely used extensions that have been flagged as risky:

| Extension Name                      | Risk/Behavior                                                                 |

| **Netflix Party / Netflix Party 2**  | Tracks browsing, injects affiliate links, privacy violations                  | 
| **Full Page Screenshot Capture**     | Tracks user data, manipulates cookies, over 200,000 downloads                |
| **friGate Light / friGate CDN**      | Contains malware, accesses sensitive data, redirects to malicious sites       | 
| **SaveFrom.Net**                     | Collects and leaks user data (IP, browsing behavior)                         |
